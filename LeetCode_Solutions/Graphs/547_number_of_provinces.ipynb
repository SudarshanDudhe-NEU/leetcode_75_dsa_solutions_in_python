       "2. **DFS Helper Function:** A helper function named `dfs` is defined for Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal. This function takes a room index as an argument and performs DFS on that room's keys by recursively calling itself on each unvisited key.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Main DFS Traversal:** In the main `canVisitAllRooms` method, the helper function `dfs` is called with the initial room index 0 (the locked room) to start the traversal.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Room Visit Tracking:** During the traversal, each visited room's index is added to the `visited` set.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **All Rooms Visitation Check:** After the DFS traversal, it checks if all rooms have been visited by comparing the length of the `visited` set with the total number of rooms. If they are equal, then all rooms can be visited.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Return Statement:** Finally, the method returns a boolean indicating whether we can visit all rooms.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rooms because each room's keys list is traversed once.\n",
       "*   Space complexity: O(n) due to the visited set which stores the indices of all visited rooms."
